Contrary to other Model-View frameworks where the View can be both responsible of displaying the data items and handling user interaction, Qt uses the **delegate** concept to separate these responsibilities from the View. This allows flexibility in the way how user input is obtained, and how the view is painted. In short, the delegate sits between the model and the view and handles the interaction between the two.

As we have briefly discussed earlier, delegates act as templates for instantiating the visual items inside the view. We bind the data roles provided by the model to visual item properties, such as the `Text.text` or `Image.source` property. Delegates can also be used to modify and update the data bound to the roles. In this example, we have a `TeamDelegate` that updates the bound data when clicked:

```qml
ListModel {
    id: teamModel
    ListElement {
        teamName: "Team C++"
        teamColor: "blue"
    }
}

ListView {
    anchors.fill: parent
    model: teamModel
    delegate: TeamDelegate {}
}

// TeamDelegate.qml
Component {
    Text {
        text: teamName
        color: teamColor

        MouseArea {
            anchors.fill: parent
            onClicked: {
                    model.teamName = "Team Quick"
                    model.teamColor = "red"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Within the delegate, we have access to the [data roles](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-modelviewsdata-modelview.html#qml-data-models) as internal properties. We also have the property `model` available to us, which can be used to access the roles without naming conflicts.

### Interacting with the view and the model

Until now, we have been modifying and accessing the item data provided for us. but how can the delegate access the view or the model without depending on a certain `id` (ie. inside a `Component` file)?

We are in luck, as we have access to the bound view from within the delegate through the [attached properties](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-listview.html#attached-properties) with for example `ListView.view`, `GridView.view` or `PathView.view`. **Note**: these properties are only attached to the root of delegate object, not to any child objects. Read more about the semantics of attached properties [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html#attached-properties-and-attached-signal-handlers). 

As the `ListView.view` contains the view, we can access the underlying model through the `ListView.view.model` property. Any defined properties and signals within the view are also accessible. This is very useful if you want to reuse the same delegate for multiple views, but want a visual feature to be different for each type of view. Thus we are no longer dependent on any specific view or model.

Here we have the properties `quality` and `color` in our `ListModel` and `ListView` respectively. Notice how we need to access the properties through the root object `team`.

```qml
ListModel {
    id: teamModel

    property string quality: "good"

    ListElement {
        teamName: "Team C++"
    }
}

ListView {
    anchors.fill: parent

    property string color: "purple"

    model: teamModel
    delegate: TeamDelegate {}
}

// TeamDelegate.qml
Component {
    Row {
        id: team
        spacing: 2

        Text {
            text: model.teamName
            color: team.ListView.view.color
        }

        Text {
            text: "Quality: " + team.ListView.view.model.quality
        }
    }
}

```

In most of the views, like `ListView`, we have the attached property of `ListView.isCurrentItem` that can be used to change the appearance of the currently selected item:

```qml
// ContactsDelegate.qml
Component {
    id: contactsDelegate
    Rectangle {
        id: wrapper
        width: 180
        height: contactInfo.height
        color: ListView.isCurrentItem ? "black" : "red"
        Text {
            id: contactInfo
            text: name + ": " + address
            color: wrapper.ListView.isCurrentItem ? "red" : "black"
        }
    }
}
```
*K: More attached properties (onPath?) could be discussed here. Something visual*

# Dynamic Delegate - Loader (P0 | 2h)

_[Explanation of the contents of a topic page @ Topic reference page](https://github.com/TestMyQt/material-outline/wiki/Topic-reference-page)_  

_[Back to Week 3](https://github.com/TestMyQt/material-outline/wiki/Week-3)_

_Objective: Efficient delegate implementation_

### Beginner

* What is a delegate? (3.06)
* What is lazy loading?

### Intermediate

* What is an efficient delegate implementation?
* What is a dynamic delegate?
* How lazy loading could be used in Repeater? 

*Tino: The one above could refer to the earlier Repeater synchronous example.*

*Tino: I got feedback from the Qt Quick team that dynamic delegates with Loader should be always avoided. Loader is almost as bad as any other extra item in the delegate. It should be emphasised here that the best practise is to create simple delegates, where no dynamic loading is needed. To create the dynamic part, Qt.createComponent/createObject should be used that Loader object is not needed to be created. Loader is convenient though and can be mentioned as well, but with clear remark that it's not the best option.*

When using `Repeater` or dynamic views, delegates need to be created very quickly. If the delegate creation process is computationally expensive, it can affect the startup time of your application and overall performance of the user interface.

As previously mentioned, `Repeater` creates elements synchronously. For simple items, this is very convenient and the generation happens instantaneously. Problems arise when `Repeater` needs to load delegates containing [`Video`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtmultimedia-video.html) items all auto-playing video for some odd reason:

```qml
Item {
    id: videoDelegate

    Video {
        id: video
        width: 800
        height: 600
        source: model.videosrc
        autoPlay: true
    }
}
```

The target platform is low-end devices, and loading all these items at startup will take an noticeable amount of time. Some devices might not be able to play multiple video sources at the same time.

*Insert emphasis: create simple delegates where no dynamic loading is needed*

If there is a need to load resource intensive items inside a delegate, we can create objects dynamically.

[Dynamic object creation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-javascript-dynamicobjectcreation.html)

Qt Quick has the `Loader` type, which can be used to load different parts of the UI, like delegates, to improve performance.

*Insert emphasis: not the best option available!*

Here we have delegate which has a `Component` where the video will be contained. We add a `Loader` and a `MouseArea` to the delegate, so when clicked the `sourceComponent` property will be set to the `videoComponent`. This change will trigger the `Loader` to load the `videoComponent` component.

```qml
Item {
    id: lazyVideoDelegate

    width: 200
    height: 200

    Component {
        id: videoComponent

        Video {
            id: video
            width: 800
            height: 600
            source: model.videosrc
            autoPlay: true
        }
    }

    Loader {
        id: videoLoader
    }

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: videoLoader.sourceComponent = videoComponent
    }
}
```

Notice that while a `Video` item declared by itself would be automatically rendered and displayed, this is not the case for the above as the item is defined inside a Component.

This will reduce the load time considerably, as the delegate will only contain lightweight `Loader` and `MouseArea` objects initially. This will also reduce memory consumption and runtime overhead of the application, which will reflect in more responsive UI. We can of course add an `Image` which displays a thumbnail of the video or something similar.

UX: can show splash screen when loading main application or parts of application.

Example: we have a delegate that contains a camera. Every time the delegate is loaded, the loading operation will take 500ms and will block the UI. We could also have a `Repeater` with heavy delegates, it will instantiate all of them and kill performance.

Solution: we will create a lightweight delegate that uses the [`Loader`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-loader.html) type to load QML components asynchronously. When the user interacts with the delegate (hover, click, etc...) we trigger the loader.

*K: Context problems! In the following example, the index context property inserted by the ListView into delegateComponent's context will be inaccessible to Text, as the Loader will use the creation context of myComponent as the parent context when instantiating it, and index does not refer to anything within that context chain.*

*Tino: Indeed. ListView will create delegates dynamically, so the use of Loader is obsolete here or actually increases memory consumption and should not be used. Just refer to the component id. The use of Loader us useful to dynamically load some heavy part of the delegate. E.g. the Text is light, but using a Camera would be heavy not to mention using a Repeater in the delegate to create 1,000,000 text objects.*

```qml
Item {
    width: 400
    height: 400

    Component {
        id: myComponent
        Text { text: modelIndex }    //okay
    }

    ListView {
        anchors.fill: parent
        model: 5
        delegate: Component {
            Loader {
                property int modelIndex: index
                sourceComponent: myComponent
            }
        }
    }
}
```
