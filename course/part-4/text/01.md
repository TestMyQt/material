# 4.01 Model/view framework

Many applications need to display data to the user. Applications may even allow user to manipulate and create new data. Qt model/view framework makes it easy for the developer to create such applications. The model is separated from the view, allowing several views to share the same model or one view to change the model on the on-the-fly. 

![Model/view chart](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/images/modelview-overview.png)

- Model is an adapter to the data and its structure. The actual data may be stored anywhere, for example in the database or some data center in the cloud. In trivial cases, the model itself can contain the data. QML contains several types for creating models, but for efficiency reasons a 'QAbstractItemModel' subclass is more frequently used. 
- View displays the data in any kind of a visual structure, such as a list, table or path. There are views for stacking items [`StackView`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls-stackview.html) or scrolling large content [`ScrollView`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls-scrollview.html), but these views use internal models and provide a specialised API, so they are not covered here. Developers can create custom views as well to structure the UI in any way, they want.
- Delegate dictates how the data should appear in the view. The delegate takes each data item in the model and encapsulates it. The model data is accessible through the delegate.

## Essential concepts

Dynamic views, like [`ListView`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-listview.html), have a model and create and destroy delegate items dynamically to display data items. Any variant type can be assigned to the view's `model` property. In the following example, an integer 5 is assigned to the model, resulting that the view will create five delegates. As the model may be any variant type, it is possible to assign a JavaScript, `QList`, a QML model type or `QAbstractItemModel` subclass, which will be covered in the next phase. 

```qml
ListView {
    anchors.fill: parent
    model: 5
    delegate: Component {
        Text {
            text: index
        }
    }
}
```

The delegate type is `Component`. Components define re-usable, well-defined QML types similarly to QML files, but the type is defined as an inline file. The view manages the delegate item life time. Different views use different strategies to manage the life time and we will return to this in Chapter Views. Note that `delegate` is a default property in `ListView` and often omitted in the declaration. 

An `index` value is assigned to the `text` property. Where did the index come from. The view exposes several properties to all delegate items. The `Ã¬ndex` property is a context property, which means that each delegate item will have a different index value, even though the property name is the same. The first index is 0, the next one 1 and so on. This is a useful way to identify each delegate object. 

### Basic QML models  

A simple and commonly used QML model type is [`ListModel`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html), which is a container for [`ListElement`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listelement.html) definitions. In [`ListElement`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listelement.html), the data is defined with **named role definitions** instead of properties, even though the syntax is the same.  Note that the role names must be common with all other elements in a given model. 

In the following example there are two roles, the name of a person and a color representing their team. 

```qml
ListModel {
    id: teamModel
    ListElement { name: "Lars Knoll"; teamColor: "red" }
    ListElement { name: "Alan Kay"; teamColor: "lightBlue" }
    ListElement { name: "Trygve Reenskaug"; teamColor: "red" }
    ListElement { name: "Adele Goldberg"; teamColor: "yellow" }
    ListElement { name: "Ole-Johan Dahl"; teamColor: "red" }
    ListElement { name: "Kristen Nygaard"; teamColor: "lightBlue" }
}
```

The type of a role is fixed the first time the role is used. All roles in the previous example are string types. Dynamic roles allow assigning different types to roles as well. To enable dynamic roles, the 'ListModel' property 'dynamicRoles' must be set to true. The data that is statically defined, like in the previous example, cannot have dynamic roles. The data items with dynamic roles must be added with JavaScript.

The view exposes roles to delegate items, which can refer to roles by just using the role names as in the following example. If `Text` QML type contained a property called `name`, `model` qualifier must be used as a prefix to the role to avoid a name clash. An additional property `modelData` is exposed to delegates, if the model is a list. 

```qml
ListView {
    anchors.fill: parent
    model: teamModel
    delegate: Text {
        text: name
        // text: modelData.name // in case there is a clash between roles and properties
    }
}
```

### Exercise - Picture frame (01_PictureFrame)

Create an empty Qt Quick Controls application.

* Add a `ListModel` and add at least one `ListElement`. The list element should have a fileUrl role, which refers to image file URLs. 

* Add a `ListView` filling the whole window area.

* Use a `BorderImage` delegate to show the images. All images can have a fixed size, e.g. 400 x 300 pixels. 

## Model manipulation

Creating and manipulating model data statically, as we did in earlier examples, is not scalable in real world applications. Data items can be manipulated in JavaScript, but more frequently C++ models are used as we will see in Phase 5. 'ListModel' has methods to [`append()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html#append-method), [`insert()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html#insert-method), [`move()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html#move-method), and [`remove()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html#remove-method).

The following example shows, how to data to a `ListModel` with `append`:

```qml
ListModel {
    id: teamModel
    ListElement {
        name: "Team C++"
    }
}

MouseArea {
    anchors.fill: parent
    onClicked: {
        teamModel.append({ name: "Team Quick" })
    }
}
```

To create new items, you can use JSON `{ "teamName": "Team Qt", "teamColor": "green" }` or JavaScript notation `{ teamName: "Team Qt", teamColor: "green" }`. It should be noted that the first item inserted or declared to the model will determine the roles available to any views. In other words, if the model is empty and an item is added, only roles defined in that item are bound and used in subsequent added items. To reset the roles, the model needs to be emptied with the [ListModel::clear()](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/qml-qtqml-models-listmodel.html#clear-method) method.

### Exercise - PictureFrame with add and remove actions (1/8)

This exercise is first of many during Part 4 where you add functionality to the PictureFrame application. It will not be tested in TMC, instead just start a fresh QML application and add things there every time a PictureFrame exercise comes up. You can use the code from the last exercise as a starting point. The exercise will be returned to be peer-reviewed after the final part of it is done. You will then be graded based on which parts you did (i.e. if you get stuck you can skip one of the parts and continue).

Instructions: Add an action to menu to add and remove images from the model.

* The add image action should open a file dialog, where the user can choose multiple image files to be added to the model.

* The remove action should remove the last image from the model. Do not try to remove any image from an empty model.

* Hint: Adding actions and a menu bar is easy, if you change `Window` to `ApplicationWindow`.

### Threaded model manipulation

Modifying the model can be computationally expensive in some cases, and because we are doing it inside the UI thread, it can end up being blocked for quite a while. Consider a trivial case of creation 1,000,000 items into the model. Computationally heavy updates should preferably be done inside a background thread. For example, if we were to implement a Twitch chat client, we would run into performance problems very fast if we were to use the main thread for updating the message model:

```qml
TwitchChat {
    // signal messageReceived(string user, string message)
    onMessageReceived: {
        // Massage the received message data inside the signal handler ...
        // Remove old messages from backlog ...
        if (messageModel.count > 2147483647)
           messageModel.remove(0, 1337)
        // Append the message data to the model
        messageModel.append({"user": user, "message": message})
    }
}
```

Qt provides a QML type [`WorkerScript`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-workerscript.html) to offload any heavy data and model manipulation out of the main thread. Messages are passed between the parent thread and new child thread with the `sendMessage()` method and `onMessage()` handler:

```qml
TwitchChat {
    // signal messageReceived(string user, string message)
    onMessageReceived: {
        worker.sendMessage({"user": user, "message": message, "model": messageModel)
    }
}

WorkerScript {
    id: worker
    source: 'script.js'
}

```

The `onMessage` handler is implemented in the `script.js` file which is invoked when `sendMessage()` is called:

```qml
// script.js
WorkerScript.onMessage = function(msg) {
    // Massage the received message data ...
    // Remove old messages from backlog ...
    if (msg.model.count > 2147483647)
        msg.model.remove(0, 1337)
    // Append the message data to the model
    msg.model.append({"user": user, "message": message});
    msg.model.sync();    // Needs to be called!
}
```

Notice that the `script.js` file is not imported anywhere! This brings in the restrictions of this threading model: the `source` property is evaluated on its own outside of QML. This means any properties or methods, and all data needs to be passed to `sendMessage()`. The `sendMessage()` supports all JavaScript types and objects. Arbitrary `QObject` types are not supported, only the `ListModel` type. Also, if you want your modifications to take effect in the `ListModel`, you must call `sync()` on it on the worker thread.

### Exercise - PictureFrame with background model manipulation (2/8)

Add yet another action to the menu. When triggered, the action should add 10,000 copies of one of the model fileUrls to the model. 

* Obviously, the UI must be kept responsive all the time.
