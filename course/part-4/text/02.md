# 4.02 QML Models

_Objective: XML parsing in QML_

*J:While XML is something to be introduced, at least for the starters we probably won't need exercises for it.*

*Tino: I disagree. The level of understanding XML is that there is a tag, possibly an attribute, and data. That is trivial. So, yes exercise please, because this may be fun.*

*Kimmo: Explained some XML and XPath details, reworded some things to be a bit more explicit/correct*

*Tino: Objective: XML parsing in QML. (This is what the model actually does)*

### XmlListModel
Qt Quick provides an easy and convenient way to construct models from XML data with [XmlListModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-xmllistmodel-xmllistmodel.html).

If we have XML document of the form
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
    <channel>
        <item>
            <title>A blog post</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2010 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate>
        </item>
        <item>
            <title>Another blog post</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2010 15:35:01 GMT</pubDate>
        </item>
    </channel>
</rss>
```
We can see that XML documents have **tags** (`<rss>`), which can have **attributes** (`version="2.0"`). Start tag `<item>` and end tag `</item>` form an **element**, and an element can have child elements. This basically means we have a tree of nodes, and we need to traverse the tree to extract data.

We can construct a model the following way:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.XmlListModel 2.0

XmlListModel {
    id: xmlModel
    source: "http://www.mysite.com/feed.xml"
    query: "/rss/channel/item"

    XmlRole { name: "title"; query: "title/string()" }
    XmlRole { name: "pubDate"; query: "pubDate/string()" }
}
```
In `source` we define the location for the XML document, which can be either local or remote resource.

The `query` property value should contain a valid [XPath (XML Path Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) selector. Among other things, XPath is used to select nodes from the XML document tree that match a given path expression. 

With the query of `/rss/channel/item` we select any `<item>` that are children of `<channel>` that are children of the document root element `<rss>` to be the items for the model. See [XPath usage examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath#Usage_examples) for more detailed usage.

Now that we have data for our model, we need to define roles with [`XmlRole`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-xmllistmodel-xmlrole.html) definitions to bind our data for our delegates. Notice that the `<item>` elements contain other arbitrary elements, so we need a query to bind specific data. In the example, we query the `<title>` and `<pubDate>` elements inside the `<item>`, get their values with the `string()` function and bind the value to the aptly named roles `title` and `pubDate`. See [`XmlRole::query`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-xmllistmodel-xmlrole.html#query-prop) for more examples.

Using the generated models in `ListView` works as usual, we can access the defined roles inside our delegate:
```qml
ListView {
    width: 180; height: 300
    model: xmlModel
    delegate: Text { text: title + ": " + pubDate }
}
```
