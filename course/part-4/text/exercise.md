# Exercise for Part 4 - TV Guide

Your task is to implement a TV Guide application. The application allows the user to browse TV programs from several channels. One source for the channel and program data is [Telkussa](https://telkussa.fi/), but obviously any other services can be used. 

* The application should show TV programs of at least ten channels. 

* Organise channels in a vertical list. 

* Each row in the list should show at least the channel name and the current date's TV programs. Display the TV programs in a horizontal list, organised in a chronological order. 

* If a TV program name is clicked on, show more detailed description of the program. QML dialogs could be used for this. 

* Do not try to implement everything in a single source code file. Keep models and views in their own files. 

* Avoid hard-coded magic numbers. Make at least the view sizes scalable. The font and image sizes may be fixed.
