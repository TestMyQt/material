### Items and their properties

QML types are structures in the markup language, and they represent visual and non-visual parts.  
Non-visual QML types include functionality, such as states, transitions, models, paths, gradients and timers. 

Using `Item` as the top-level QML object (as the root item of the window) will not produce a visual result. If you wish your top-level QML object to produce a visual result, use the `Rectangle` object instead. Use the `Item` to create opacity effects, such as when creating an invisible container to hold other components.

All visual items in Qt Quick inherit from `Item`. Although an `Item` object has no visual appearance, it defines all the attributes that are common across visual items, such as x and y position, width and height, anchoring and key handling support. It supports layering and is usually used to group visual types.

The `Item` type can be useful for grouping several items under a single root visual item. For example:

*E: [I want this code redone/made better and visualised at some point]*

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    id: root
    Image {
        id: imageOne
        source: "tile.png"
    }
    Image {
        id: imageTwo
        x: 80
        width: 100
        height: 100
        source: "tile.png"
    }
    Image {
        id: imageThree
        x: 190
        width: 100
        height: 100
        fillMode: Image.Tile
        source: "tile.png"
    }
}
```  
 
Please note that we are only using "magic numbers" in the examples to get you started. In general, you should try to bind x, y, width and height to the parent, or another item.

As you can see from the example, QML objects are described by properties. The properties are simple name-value definitions (width, height etc.) and they are separated by semicolons or line breaks. Properties are used for customizing appearance and changing behaviour.  
The `id` property is a special property used to identify QML objects. It is used to create relationships between objects. The `id` property of an object allows other objects refer to it in regard to:

* Relative realignment and positioning
* To use its properties
* To change its properties (e.g. for animation)
* For re-use of common types (e.g. gradients, images).

For example:

```qml
Item { 
    width: 300; height: 115 
    Text { 
        id: title 
        x: 50; y: 25 
        text: "Qt Quick" 
        font { family: "Helvetica"; pointSize: parent.width * 0.1 } 
    } 
    
    Rectangle { 
        x: title.x; y: title.y + title.height - height; height: 5 
        width: title.width 
        color: "green" 
    }
} 
```

The concept of `QObject` inheritance was discussed in Part 1. In this part we will be taking a look at visual parents and children, and it is important to understand how the concept differs from `QObject` inheritance. An item's visual parent may not necessarily be the same as its object parent.
The concept of the visual parent in Qt Quick is separate from, but related to, the concept of the object parent within the `QObject` parent hierarchy.

All QML objects have an object parent, which is determined by the object hierarchy in which the object is declared. When working with the `QtQuick` module, the `Item` type is the base type for all visual items provided by this module, and it provides the concept of an additional visual parent, as defined by an item's parent property. Every item has a visual parent; if an item's parent property value is `null`, the item will not be rendered in the scene.

Any object assigned to an item's data property becomes a child of the item within its `QObject` hierarchy, for memory management purposes. Additionally, if an object added to the data property is of the `Item` type, it is also assigned to the `Item::children` property and becomes a child of the item within the visual scene hierarchy. (Most Qt Quick hierarchy crawling algorithms, especially the rendering algorithms, only consider the visual parent hierarchy.)

For convenience, the `Item` data property is its default property. This means that any child item declared within an `Item` object without being assigned to a specific property is automatically assigned to the data property and becomes a child of the item as described above. So, the two code blocks below produce the same result, and you will almost always see the form shown below: 

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    width: 100; height: 100
    
    Rectangle { 
        width: 50;
        height: 50;
        color: "red"
    }
}
```

Rather than the explicit data assignment:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    width: 100; height: 100

    data: [
        Rectangle {
            width: 50;
            height: 50;
            color: "red"
        }
    ]
}
```

An item's visual parent can be changed at any time by setting its parent property. Thus, an item's visual parent may not necessarily be the same as its object parent.

When an item becomes the child of another item:

* The child's parent refers to its parent item
* The parent's `children` and `childrenRect` properties take that child into account

Declaring an item as a child of another does not automatically mean that the child item will be appropriately positioned or sized to fit within its parent. Some QML types may have in-built behaviors that affect the positioning of child items — for example, a `Row` object automatically re-positions its children into a horizontal formation — but these are behaviors enforced by the types' own specific implementations. Additionally, a parent item will not automatically clip its children to visually contain them within the parent's visual bounds, unless its `clip` property is set to true.

### Rectangle

`Rectangle` items are used to fill areas with solid color or gradients, and/or to provide a rectangular border.

Each `Rectangle` item is painted using either a solid fill color, specified using the color property, or a gradient, defined using a `Gradient` type and set using the gradient property. If both a color and a gradient are specified, the gradient is used.

You can add an optional border to a rectangle with its own color and thickness by setting the `border.color` and `border.width` properties. Set the color to "transparent" to paint a border without a fill color.

You can also create rounded rectangles using the `radius` property. Since this introduces curved edges to the corners of a rectangle, it may be appropriate to set the `Item::antialiasing` property to improve its appearance.

For example:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    width: 100
    height: 100
    color: "red"
    border.color: "black"
    border.width: 5
    radius: 10
}
```

### Text, Image, BorderImage

Beyond [`Rectangle`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-rectangle.html), you will often use types such as [`Text`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-text.html), [`Image`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-image.html), and [`BorderImage`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-borderimage.html). Their usage follows the same principles, and you should look at the official documentation behind the links.
