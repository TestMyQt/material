## Course material content

Last week we mainly worked on introductory topics about Qt, discussing application logic, which drives the inner workings of your applications. In addition to logic, however, we usually want to create a user interface for the user to interact with as well. Preferably a flashy, cool looking graphical user interface that shoots lasers and plays disco music when the user interacts with the interface.  Who doesn't love lasers and disco music?!

This week we are going to be talking about creating user interfaces using Qt Quick. The tool we will be using is the declarative scripting language QML. When creating applications with Qt, you should use C++ for the application logic and QML only for the user interface. The numbers vary per application, but you could imagine roughly 80% of your code being written in C++ and the remaining 20% in QML. 

JavaScript can be used to enrich user interface description, however we will mainly focus on QML during this course.  Please note that as with QML, JavaScript should only be used for the user interface, as performance will almost always be worse with logic implemented using JavaScript in comparison to C++.

We will return to the topic of interconnecting application logic written in C++ with QML in Week 4.

In the Qt Creator there exists a graphical UI design tool, called Qt Quick Designer, which we will not be using during this course. QML is simple enough to be written and understood without the design mode.

### Qt Quick

Qt Quick is a module, consisting of types and functionality for QML. It includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. A QML application developer can get access to all of that functionality with a single import statement.

The Qt Quick QML library is provided by the Qt Quick module. For in-depth information about the various QML types and other functionality provided by Qt Quick, please see the [Qt Quick module](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html) documentation.

When using the Qt Quick module, you will need to know how to write QML applications using the QML language.

Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can efficiently work with the same product development project, without long cycles, waiting designers to change or developers implement certain UI features. This can significantly reduce the require product development time.

### QML

QML stands for Qt Meta-Object Language, AKA Qt Modelling Language, and it's a user interface markup language. 

The Qt QML module provides a framework for developing applications and libraries with the QML language. It defines and implements the language and engine infrastructure, and provides an API to enable application developers to extend the QML language with custom types and integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++. The Qt QML module provides both a QML API and a C++ API.

You'll want to work on your application logic using C++. It will in most cases result in better performance than implementing logic using JavaScript.

QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one another. It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to be easily reused and customized within a user interface. Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user interfaces in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end C++ libraries.

With QML, UI components are declared with objects, object properties and property bindings, set to define the application behavior. Application behavior can be further scripted through JavaScript, which is a subset of the language. In addition, QML heavily uses Qt, which allows types and other Qt features to be accessible directly from QML applications.

### .qml -files and QML syntax

[Something all around useful to know about .qml files if there is something, such as that in general they are a thing that exists]

[Something all around useful to know about where the .qml files are located in projects and/or directory structure]

QML is a multi-paradigm language that enables objects to be defined in terms of their attributes and how they relate and respond to changes in other objects. In contrast to purely imperative code, where changes in attributes and behavior are expressed through a series of statements that are processed step by step, QML's declarative syntax integrates attribute and behavioral changes directly into the definitions of individual objects. These attribute definitions can then include imperative code, in the case where complex custom application behavior is needed.

QML source code is generally loaded by the engine through QML (.qml) documents, which are standalone documents of QML code. These can be used to define QML object types that can then be reused throughout an application. Note that type names must begin with an uppercase letter in order to be declared as QML object types in a QML file.

A QML document may have one or more imports at the top of the file. An import can be any one of:

* a versioned namespace into which types have been registered (e.g., by a plugin)
* a relative directory which contains type-definitions as QML documents
* a JavaScript file

JavaScript file imports must be qualified when imported, so that the properties and methods they provide can be accessed.  

The generic form of the various imports are as follows:

```qml
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor as SingletonTypeIdentifier
import "directory"
import "file.js" as ScriptIdentifier
```

Examples:
```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.LocalStorage 2.0 as Database
import "../privateComponents"
import "somefile.js" as Script
```

The contents of a QML file is constructed as an object tree, much like C++ object trees.  
Each QML file contains exactly one root object, with any number of children. The root is also the owner of the children.  
The following example includes 4 objects; Item, Image, MouseArea and NumberAnimation.

![Example QML]({{ "/assets/images/part-2/cookie_clicker_qml_file.png" | absolute_url }})

The Item-object is the root object of this particular QML file. It has the children Image, MouseArea (which is of course also the child object of Image) and NumberAnimation. All of the objects naturally have properties, which describe the objects. 

### Including QML in your projects

To include QML in your projects, you need to complete these three steps:  

1. To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    ```cpp
    #include <QtQml>
    ```

2. The QML types in Qt QML are available through the QtQML import. To use the types, add the following import statement to your .qml file:

    ```qml
    import QtQml 2.0
    ```

3. To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    ```qmake
    QT += qml
    ```

### Prototyping with Quick UI projects and qmlscene

To prototype user interfaces even more quickly, one can create a [Qt Quick UI](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/quick-projects.html) project. These projects do not contain any C++ code, resource `.qrc` or deployment code (`qmake` files). This way the potential designer can launch the application without compiling any code or developer can quickly share proof-of-concepts.

One can also enable a keyboard shortcut for the prototyping application [`qmlscene`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-qmlscene.html), which renders any arbitary `.qml` files. `qmlscene` can be enabled in Qt Creator by going to `Options -> Environment -> Keyboard -> search for qmlscene -> assign shortcut`. When a `.qml` file is open in the Edit or Design mode, hit the shortcut to render the file.
