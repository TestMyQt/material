### Part 1.01

- It's a bit confusing that the example in 1.01 of missing QtConcurrent first says that the QtConcurrent must be added to the .pro file and next it's shown what happens when the user does not do this.

- Subchapter qmake mentions that you can use qmake for any software project. Should it specify c/c++ software project, or is there support for other languages in qmake? 

- Typo in QDebug chapter equilavent -> equivalent

- In the part about shadow builds, should there be some instructions how to configure the project defaults for the assignments here instead of the part 0? Not that probably many of the students need that anyway, but there's quite a lot of choices to play with if you're not sure what to do.

- Assignment is quite easy, but then again it's hello world.
