# 1.00 - Creating and debugging Qt projects

Hello! Welcome aboard the Qt MOOC!

This topic will cover most of the basic things you should need when working on this course. 
In this topic we will discuss Qt projects in general, and from the perspective of this course in the form of our exercises. We will run trough some of the documentation of key concepts that will help you understand the fundamentals of working with Qt. It should also let you get familiar with the official Qt documentation, that we will be using as a study aide alongside this course. We will also discuss some aspects of builds, qmake, and debugging messages.

If all of this is familiar to you, you may proceed to completing the exercise and moving on to the more specific topics. We won't hold it against you if you come crawling back to read about the basics when you have no idea what's going on after completing once another Hello World.

### Qt Projects, Qt Namespace, Global Qt Declarations and macros

Before we start with the heavy lifting, we are going to introduce some basic concepts to help you get started with the wonderful world of creating with Qt! We are also going to introduce some parts of the official documentation, as it will be an important tool for you in addition to the course materials. We want to provide you with what we feel will be of use for any student working on this course.

The basic concepts that we will take a closer look at are global declarations, modules and namespaces in Qt.

Let's talk about the global declarations in Qt. You can find an exhaustive list of global declarations at http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html.  
The global declarations include types, functions and macros. You do not have to memorize this list before proceeding into the next chapter, but it is important that you know what it is and what you can use it for, as you may find it useful on various occasions while working on this course. In the end of this topic we will discuss some useful debugging functions found in the global declaration.

The type definitions are partly convenience definitions for basic types (some of which guarantee certain bit-sizes on all platforms supported by Qt), partly types related to Qt message handling. The functions are related to generating messages, Qt version handling, and comparing and adjusting object values. And finally, some of the declared macros enable programmers to add compiler or platform specific code to their applications, while others are convenience macros for larger operations.

We will explicitly refer you to the global declarations list in assignments or learning topics where we feel it is necessary.

Next, let's talk about the modules in Qt. Here is a list of the modules in Qt: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html.  
To include modules into your project you need to include them in your projects' `.pro` file. If you are using qmake, the Core and GUI modules will be included by default. If you aren't using the GUI module in your project (which we for the most parts won't during the first week, anyway), simply disable it by writing `QT -= GUI` in your projects `.pro` file. All of the other Qt modules rely on the Qt Core module.

Next, it's time to take a look at some essentials regarding namespaces and their use in Qt. 
Here is a list of the main namespaces in Qt: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/namespaces.html.  
We will not be using all of these namespaces during the course, but before getting our hands dirty, we feel that you will have some benefit of having been introduced to this list beforehand. In general, we will summarize exhaustive reference materials in a link list at the end of each topic.

Let's have an example of including namespaces! Say you want to include the QtConcurrent namespace in your code. Let's take a closer look at the documentation page for QtConcurrent:

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentNamespace.png" | absolute_url }})

To include the QtConcurrent namespace, you will need to make a specific mention of it in two places: the header of the relevant file (`#include <QtConcurrent>`), and the project `.pro` file (`QT += concurrent`).

To include the QtConcurrent namespace, you will need to make a specific mention of it in two places: the header of the relevant file (`#include <QtConcurrent>`), and the project `.pro` file (`QT += concurrent`).

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentNoSuchFile.png" | absolute_url }})

We followed the instructions, but the Qt Creator is telling me the file is missing! What do we do? We could always try pressing SHIFT+TAB at the end of the include name and see what happens next.

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentNoSuchFileDropdown.png" | absolute_url }})

The QtConcurrent is visible in the dropdown list that appeared! Are we good to go here?

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentQtConcurrent.png" | absolute_url }})

Well, it looks like we have our include all sorted now, however this doesn't look like what the documentation suggested?

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentInProFile.png" | absolute_url }})

The reason as to why simply writing `#include <QtConcurrent>` wasn't enough is that we didn't specify the flag `QT += concurrent` in the `.pro` profile file and save it first. 
Having done so, let's now look at what happens when we want to `#include <QtConcurrent>`:

![]({{ "/assets/images/part-1/topic00-QtConcurrentWorks.png" | absolute_url }})

Much better. Consider this your crash course in using includes in Qt.

In this list, we can see that there exists a namespace for Qt at https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qt.html.  
Here you can find miscellaneous identifiers used throughout the Qt library. This is the list we are expecting you to memorize before proceeding to the next chapter of this topic.

Just kidding! We're just letting you know it's there if you happen to need to use it as reference material for anything.

### Exercise structure

Having finished covering the basics, it's time to take a look at the structural composition of the exercises.  
Each exercise is located in its own subdirectory in the main exercise directory of each week. The exercise consists of a `.pro` file at the root level, in addition to a couple of directories.  
The `.pro` file at the root level is the project file for the exercise project.  We will further discuss project files later in this chapter. But for now, we will focus on the project structure. 

The local tests that will be testing your exercises are located in the `test_runner` directory.  

If you are having problems figuring out why your exercise isn't passing the tests and you have exhausted all other alternatives, it may be worth looking at the test runner files. Figuring out what the tests are testing may give you a clue as to what may be the problem in your code. You may even alter the local tests if it helps you understand the problem better. On a rare occasion, the problem may be that the tests themselves are faulty. In this case we recommend joining the course channel to see if others are having the same problem. We have done everything we can to make sure this does not happen, but there are always edge cases.
Please take note that the local tests are only there to tell you if your exercise is fully completed and ready to be submitted. You cannot alter the tests to your liking, and expect to pass the exercise by submitting an incomplete assignment! We will test your exercise on the server before you receive points for it! Some times there may even be hidden tests serverside, for making sure that you aren't trying to complete the exercises based on what the tests are testing for instead of completing the actual exercise to support your learning.

The `src` directory is where the magic, by which we mean your coding, will take place.  

It includes the relevant source and header files for each exercise project. In some cases there may be additional directories included for libraries, and in some cases we may ask you to create new directories. Nobody knows if! Nobody knows when! Nobody knows how! But we'll figure that out later.  

Have you already noticed how every directory has its own `.pro` file? What does this all mean? It's like trying to figure out the plot line of Lost! The reason for this is, that every subdirectory we have included in the exercise directory are actually projects within the actual exercise project (spoiler: this is also the plot line of Lost)! Let us elaborate and take look at the root level `.pro` file:

```qmake
TEMPLATE = subdirs
SUBDIRS += \
      src \
      test_runner

      test_runner.depends = src
```

This tells qmake, which we will discuss next in this chapter, that the exercise project follows a build template called `subdirs`, and defines the subdirectories to be included in this project. Using the subdirectories template requires each declared subdirectory to be its own project and have its own project file included in said subdirectory.  In the end, we declare the test runner subdirectory to be dependent of the source directory. This is because we want to build your exercise before we build the test runner so the test runner has something to test.

Having gotten this far, you should have some questions by now.  
Move on to the next chapters and we will fairly certainly have provided the answers you seek.

### qmake

The [`qmake`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html) tool helps simplify the build process for development projects across different platforms. It automates the generation of Makefiles so that only a few lines of information are needed to create each Makefile. You can use qmake for any software project, whether it is written with Qt or not.

`qmake` generates a `Makefile` based on the information in a project file. The project files use the extension `.pro`, and are usually created by project templates in Qt Creator. Project files are worked on by the developer to specify the instruction set they want `qmake` to use for their project, and are usually simple. However, more sophisticated project files can be created for complex projects. We will further discuss project files later in this chapter, but as `qmake` uses the information stored in project files, we cannot completely avoid talking about their contents when talking about `qmake`.

The fundamental behavior of `qmake` is influenced by variable declarations that define the build process of each project. Some of these declare resources, such as headers and source files, that are common to each platform. Others are used to customize the behavior of compilers and linkers on specific platforms.  
Let us elaborate by once again referring to our exercise structure, specifically the `.pro` file of the source directory:

```qmake
QT -= gui

TARGET = main

CONFIG += c++11 console
CONFIG -= app_bundle

win32 {
     CONFIG -= debug_and_release debug_and_release_target
}

DEFINES += QT_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS

SOURCES += \
     main.cpp \
     hello.cpp

 HEADERS += \
      hello.h
```

At your own discretion, you may refer to the exercise directory structure and file composition of exercise [PLACEHOLDER FOR HELLO WORLD EXERCISE NAME]. You may also refer to the [qmake variable reference](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-variable-reference.html) and reflect on the declarations in the aforementioned `.pro` file code. Can you figure out what we are trying to tell `qmake` and why? The win32 bit may not be entirely self-explanatory. We may provide an explanation for this one later on.

Platform-specific variables follow the naming pattern of the variables which they extend or modify, but include the name of the relevant platform in their name. For example, `LIBS` can be used to specify a list of libraries that a project needs to link against. Here is an example:

```qmake
unix:LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib -lmath
win32:LIBS += c:/mylibs/math.lib
```

If you feel like doing some exploring on your own, we recommend you take a look at (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-variable-reference.html) for a full list of qmake variables to browse at your own discretion.

### .pro files

In a project file, variables are used to hold lists of strings. In the simplest projects, these variables inform qmake about the configuration options to use, or supply filenames and paths to use in the build process.

qmake looks for certain variables in each project file, and it uses the contents of these to determine what it should write to a Makefile. For example, the lists of values in the HEADERS and SOURCES variables are used to tell qmake about header and source files in the same directory as the project file.

As long as you are using qmake, the Core and GUI modules are included by default.

Variables can also be used internally to store temporary lists of values, and existing lists of values can be overwritten or extended with new values.

The following snippet illustrates how lists of values are assigned to variables:

```qmake
HEADERS = mainwindow.h paintwidget.h
```

The list of values in a variable is extended in the following way:

```qmake
SOURCES = main.cpp mainwindow.cpp \    
          paintwidget.cpp
CONFIG += console
```

Note: The first assignment only includes values that are specified on the same line as the HEADERS variable. The second assignment splits the values in the SOURCES variable across lines by using a backslash (\).

### Qt resource system

The [Qt resource system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html) is a platform independent way to store application resources (images, icons, translation files, data, etc.) inside the application's executable. Resources are specified inside the **resource collection** `.qrc` file:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version="1.0">
<qresource>
    <file>images/icon.png</file>
    <file>data.txt</file>
</qresource>
</RCC>
```

The file is then included in the `.pro` file with `RESOURCES = application.qrc`. The specified files will be then compressed and included as a static C++ array. They can be accessed with [`QFile`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfile.html) or image types like any other file like so:

```cpp
QIcon icon(":/images/icon.png")
QFile file(":/data.txt");
```

### The QDebug class

The [QDebug](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdebug.html) class provides an output stream for debugging information. 

[QDebug](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdebug.html) is used whenever the developer needs to write out debugging or tracing information to a device, file, string or console.

**Basic Use**

In the common case, it is useful to call the `qDebug()` function to obtain a default QDebug object to use for writing debugging information.  

```cpp
qDebug() << "Date:" << QDate::currentDate();
qDebug() << "Types:" << QString("String") << QChar('x') << QRect(0, 10, 50, 40);
qDebug() << "Custom coordinate type:" << coordinate;
```

This constructs a `QDebug` object using the constructor that accepts a `QtMsgType` value of `QtDebugMsg`. Similarly, the `qWarning()`, `qCritical()` and `qFatal()` functions also return QDebug objects for the corresponding message types.

The class also provides several constructors for other situations, including a constructor that accepts a [`QFile`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfile.html) or any other [QIODevice](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qiodevice.html) subclass that is used to write debugging information to files, sockets, other processes, etc. The constructor that accepts a QString is used to write to a string for display or serialization.


**Formatting Options** 

QDebug formats output so that it's easily readable. It automatically adds spaces between arguments, and adds quotes around QString, QByteArray, QChar arguments.

You can tweak these options through the space(), nospace() and quote(), noquote() methods. Furthermore, QTextStream manipulators can be piped into a QDebug stream.

QDebugStateSaver limits changes to the formatting to the current scope. resetFormat() resets the options to the default ones.

**Writing Custom Types to a Stream**

Many standard types can be written to QDebug objects, and Qt provides support for most Qt value types. To add support for custom types, you need to implement a streaming operator, as in the following example:

```cpp
QDebug operator<<(QDebug debug, const Coordinate &c)
{
    QDebugStateSaver saver(debug);
    debug.nospace() << '(' << c.x() << ", " << c.y() << ')';

    return debug;
}
```

### Outputting debug information trough the use of qDebug, qWarning, qCritical and qFatal

[qDebug](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qdebug), [qWarning](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qWarning  ), [qCritical](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qCritical) and [qFatal](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qFatal) are functions defined in the Qt global declarations. The functions take a format string and a list of arguments, similar to the C `printf()` function. The format should be a Latin-1 string. To suppress any of these types, you may install your own message handler using [qInstallMessageHandler()](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qInstallMessageHandler). The functions call the message handler with the defined debug/critical/fatal/warning message. They call call the message handler, or if no message handler is present, print out the message to `stderr`. On Windows, for the most parts, the message is sent to the debugger.

```cpp
qDebug(const char *message, ...)
```

Under Windows the message is sent to the console, if it is a console application; otherwise, it is sent to the debugger. This function does nothing if QT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT was defined during compilation.

For example:

```cpp
qDebug("Items in list: %d", myList.size());
```

If you include `<QtDebug>`, a more convenient syntax is also available:

```cpp
qDebug() << "Brush:" << myQBrush << "Other value:" << i;
```

With this syntax, the function returns a QDebug object that is configured to use the QtDebugMsg message type. It automatically puts a single space between each item, and outputs a newline at the end. It supports many C++ and Qt types.

```cpp
qCritical(const char *message, ...)
```

It exits if the environment variable `QT_FATAL_CRITICALS` is not empty.

For example:

```cpp
void load(const QString &fileName)
{
     QFile file(fileName);
     if (!file.exists())
          qCritical("File '%s' does not exist!", qUtf8Printable(fileName));
}
```

If you include `<QtDebug>`, a more convenient syntax is also available:

```cpp
qCritical() << "Brush:" << myQBrush << "Other value:" << i;
```

A space is inserted between the items, and a newline is appended at the end.

```cpp
qWarning(const char *message, ...)
```

This function does nothing if `QT_NO_WARNING_OUTPUT` was defined during compilation; it exits if at the nth warning corresponding to the counter in environment variable `QT_FATAL_WARNINGS`. That is, if the environment variable contains the value 1, it will exit on the 1st message; if it contains the value 10, it will exit on the 10th message. Any non-numeric value is equivalent to 1.

For example:

```cpp
void f(int c)
{
    if (c > 200)
        qWarning("f: bad argument, c == %d", c);
}
```

If you include `<QtDebug>`, a more convenient syntax is also available:

```cpp
qWarning() << "Brush:" << myQBrush << "Other value:" << i;
```

This syntax inserts a space between each item, and appends a newline at the end.

```cpp
qFatal(const char *message, ...)
```

If you are using the default message handler this function will abort to create a core dump. On Windows, for debug builds, this function will report a _CRT_ERROR enabling you to connect a debugger to the application.

For example:
```cpp
int divide(int a, int b)
{
    if (b == 0)                                // program error
         qFatal("divide: cannot divide by zero");
    return a / b;
}
```

### Shadow builds

Now that you've successfully built your first Qt project, you might be interested in the built binaries. By default, Qt Creator builds the project in to a separate directory (`build-ProjectName-*`) as a [**shadow build**](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-glossary.html#glossary-shadow-build), which is separated from the source directory. `qmake` can also generate an **in-source** build, but this is not recommended. The benefit in shadow builds is keeping that directory clean, which makes changing between Kits or build configurations faster.
