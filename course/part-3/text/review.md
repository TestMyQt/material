### Part 3 

#### Part 3.01

- Jan has a comment on the topic "Prototyping with Quick UI projects and qmlscene" that says that the qmlscene tool is apparently deprecated? I looked at the current snapshot documentation page for qmlscene and it does not mention anything about it?

- The translation comment part was very interesting new information to me professionally.

#### Part 3.02

- As the text states itself, this is quite a heavy chapter to read. I'm not sure how much you'd forget instantly, if you're completely new to QML. Maybe some simple scoping/visual parent exercise in the middle could give the student a pause from reading that would help.

- I did not know about Qt.binding() function, that explains a lot!

#### Part 3.03

- I feel like in the BorderImage example, seeing the result of the example code would make it easier to understand. Of course the student will try it out later, but when reading the text, it feels like bit confusing concept without the image to see how the image is streched/tiled. Maybe a gif or something.

- In the Text Component part "Generally explicitly setting the size is unoptimal because it causes a layout re-calculcation, so set it if you need to." I think it should be "so set it _only_ if you need to."; unoptimal <-> suboptimal and re-calculcation <-> recalculation. 

- In the exercise it would feel a bit more like a real frame if the window size of the program would be tied to the image size too. So when the window is scaled the image+border would fit.

#### Part 3.04

- In the FocusScope example the text does not fit the 'lessImportant' input as it's width is set to 200, maybe default should be the same 300 as on the first line and the difference made with gray color or something.
- Idea of FocusScope is a bit hard to grasp, but I think it might have more to do with the complexity of the implementation than the text.
