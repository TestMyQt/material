# 3.01 - Introduction to QML

In Parts 1 and 2 we mainly worked on introductory topics about Qt, discussing application logic, which drives the inner workings of your applications. In addition to logic, however, we usually want to create a user interface for the user to interact with as well. Preferably a flashy, cool looking graphical user interface that shoots lasers and plays disco music when the user interacts with it. Who doesn't love lasers and disco music?!

In Part 3 we are going to be talking about creating user interfaces using Qt Quick. The tool we will be using is the declarative scripting language QML. When creating applications with Qt, you should use C++ for the application logic and QML only for the user interface.

JavaScript can be used to enrich user interface description, however we will mainly focus on QML during this course.  Please note that as with QML, JavaScript should only be used for the user interface, as performance will almost always be worse with logic implemented using JavaScript in comparison to C++.

We will return to the topic of interconnecting application logic written in C++ with QML in Part 5.

In the Qt Creator there exists a graphical UI design tool, called Qt Quick Designer, which we will not be using during this course. QML is simple enough to be written and understood without the design mode.

## Qt Quick

Qt Quick is a module, consisting of types and functionality for QML. It includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. A QML application developer can get access to all of that functionality with a single import statement.

The Qt Quick QML library is provided by the Qt Quick module. For in-depth information about the various QML types and other functionality provided by Qt Quick, please see the [Qt Quick module](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html) documentation.

When using the Qt Quick module, you will need to know how to write QML applications using the QML language.

Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can efficiently work with the same product development project, without long cycles, waiting designers to change or developers implement certain UI features. This can significantly reduce the require product development time.

## QML

QML stands for Qt Meta-Object Language, AKA Qt Modelling Language, and it's a user interface markup language. 

The Qt QML module provides a framework for developing applications and libraries with the QML language. It defines and implements the language and engine infrastructure, and provides an API to enable application developers to extend the QML language with custom types and integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++. The Qt QML module provides both a QML API and a C++ API.

You'll want to work on your application logic using C++. It will in most cases result in better performance than implementing logic using JavaScript.

QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one another. It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to be easily reused and customized within a user interface. Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user interfaces in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end C++ libraries.

With QML, UI components are declared with objects, object properties and property bindings, set to define the application behavior. Application behavior can be further scripted through JavaScript, which is a subset of the language. In addition, QML heavily uses Qt, which allows types and other Qt features to be accessible directly from QML applications.

## .qml -files and QML syntax

QML is a multi-paradigm language that enables objects to be defined in terms of their attributes and how they relate and respond to changes in other objects. In contrast to purely imperative code, where changes in attributes and behavior are expressed through a series of statements that are processed step by step, QML's declarative syntax integrates attribute and behavioral changes directly into the definitions of individual objects. These attribute definitions can then include imperative code, in the case where complex custom application behavior is needed.

QML source code is generally loaded by the engine through QML (.qml) documents, which are standalone documents of QML code. These can be used to define QML object types that can then be reused throughout an application.

Note that type names must begin with an uppercase letter in order to be declared as QML object types in a QML file.

### Imports

A QML document may have one or more imports at the top of the file. An import can be any one of:

* a versioned namespace into which types have been registered (e.g., by a plugin)
* a relative directory which contains type-definitions as QML documents
* a JavaScript file

JavaScript file imports must be qualified when imported, so that the properties and methods they provide can be accessed.  

The generic form of the various imports are as follows:

```qml
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor as SingletonTypeIdentifier
import "directory"
import "file.js" as ScriptIdentifier
```

Examples:
```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.LocalStorage 2.0 as Database
import "../privateComponents"
import "somefile.js" as Script
```

### QML Object tree

Syntactically, a block of QML code defines a tree of QML objects to be created. Objects are defined using object declarations that describe the type of object to be created as well as the attributes that are to be given to the object. Any object declaration can define child objects through nested object declarations. In this way, any object declaration implicitly declares an object tree that may contain any number of child objects.

For example, the Rectangle object declaration below includes a Gradient object declaration, which in turn contains two GradientStop declarations:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    width: 100
    height: 100

    gradient: Gradient {
        GradientStop { position: 0.0; color: "yellow" }
        GradientStop { position: 1.0; color: "green" }
    }
}
```

Note, however, that this is a parent-child relationship in the context of the QML object tree, not in the context of the visual scene. The concept of a parent-child relationship in a visual scene is provided by the `Item` type from the QtQuick module, which is the base type for most QML types, as most QML objects are intended to be visually rendered. We we will discuss parent-child relationship in visual scene in the next chapter.

## Including QML in your projects

To include QML in your projects, you need to complete these three steps:  

1. To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    ```cpp
    #include <QtQml>
    ```

2. The QML types in Qt QML are available through the QtQML import. To use the types, add the following import statement to your .qml file:

    ```qml
    import QtQml 2.0
    ```

3. To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    ```qmake
    QT += qml
    ```

## Prototyping with Quick UI projects and qmlscene

To prototype user interfaces even more quickly, one can create a [Qt Quick UI](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/quick-projects.html) project. These projects do not contain any C++ code, resource `.qrc` or deployment code (`qmake` files). This way the potential designer can launch the application without compiling any code or developer can quickly share proof-of-concepts.

One can also enable a keyboard shortcut for the prototyping application [`qmlscene`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-qmlscene.html), which renders any arbitary `.qml` files. `qmlscene` can be enabled in Qt Creator by going to `Options -> Environment -> Keyboard -> search for qmlscene -> assign shortcut`. When a `.qml` file is open in the Edit or Design mode, hit the shortcut to render the file.


## QML Object Attributes

Every QML object type has defined set of attributes. Each instance of an object type is created with the set of attributes that have been defined for that object type.

A property is an attribute of an object that can be assigned a static value or bound to a dynamic expression. A property's value can be read by other objects. Generally it can also be modified by another object, unless a particular QML type has explicitly disallowed this for a specific property.

A custom property of an object type may be defined in an object declaration in a QML document with the following syntax:

```qml
[default] property <propertyType> <propertyName>
```

In this way an object declaration may expose a particular value to outside objects or maintain some internal state more easily.

### Property Aliases

Property aliases are properties which hold a reference to another property. Unlike an ordinary property definition, which allocates a new, unique storage space for the property, a property alias connects the newly declared property (called the aliasing property) as a direct reference to an existing property (the aliased property).

A property alias declaration looks like an ordinary property definition, except that it requires the alias keyword instead of a property type, and the right-hand-side of the property declaration must be a valid alias reference:

```qml
[default] property alias <name>: <alias reference>
```

Unlike an ordinary property, an alias has the following restrictions:

* It can only refer to an object, or the property of an object, that is within the scope of the type within which the alias is declared.
* It cannot contain arbitrary JavaScript expressions
* It cannot refer to objects declared outside of the scope of its type.
* The alias reference is not optional, unlike the optional default value for an ordinary property; the alias reference must be provided when the alias is first declared.
* It cannot refer to grouped properties; the following code will not work:

```qml
property alias color: rectangle.border.color

Rectangle {
    id: rectangle
}
```

However, aliases to value type properties do work:

```qml
property alias rectX: object.rectProperty.x

Item {
    id: object
    property rect rectProperty
}
```

We recommend you read through the [QML Object Attributes documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html) which goes into more detail than this chapter.
