# 3.01 - Introduction to QML

// Material-Outline 2.11 Global Object: Not included, but explain global object in 3.01 or 3.02

// Intro+Quick+QML chapters need to be condensed a bit

In Parts 1 and 2 we mainly worked on Qt essentials, which can be found in almost any Qt application, no matter how trivial or complicated the application is. We were discussing about the application logic, the engine implemenating the application behaviour. In addition to logic, however, we usually want to create a user interface to interac with the engine as well. Preferably a flashy, cool looking, fluid user interface that shoots lasers and plays disco music when the user interacts with it. Who doesn't love lasers and disco music?!

In Part 3 we are going to be talking about creating user interfaces using Qt Quick. The programming language we will be using is the declarative scripting language QML, which extends the JavaScript language. Although the application logic can be implemented in JavaScript, the preferred way is to use QML and JavaScript for declaring the UI components, layouts, and animatiuons, while C++ should be used to implement the application logic. This is because performance will almost always be worse with logic implemented using JavaScript in comparison to C++.

We will return to the topic of interconnecting application logic written in C++ with QML in Part 5. In this part, we cover QML language only. 

// Olis hyvä, jos suositeltais Qt Quick Designerin käyttöä

In Qt Creator, there exists a graphical UI design tool, called Qt Quick Designer. The UIs in the course can be composed in Qt Quick Designer, but in many cases a simple text editor is almost as efficient. Qt also provides Qt Design Studio, which is mainly targeted at designers. It allows UI designer to import graphic assets from Adobe Photoshop and further the SW developer to use the UI design, composed in Qt Design Studio. However, for the course exercises Qt Design Studio is little bit too overwhelming. 

## Qt Quick

Qt Quick is a module, consisting of all the basic types and functionality for QML. It includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. A QML application developer can get access to all of that functionality by importing the corresponding QML modules. The modules are plugins, providing types for the QML engine. A trivial module may be just a folder, consisting of QML text files. 

The Qt Quick QML library is provided by the Qt Quick module. For in-depth information about the various QML types and other functionality provided by Qt Quick, please see the [Qt Quick module](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html) documentation.

When using the Qt Quick module, you will need to know how to write QML applications using the QML language.

Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can efficiently work with the same product development project, without long cycles, waiting designers to change or developers implement certain UI features. This can significantly reduce round--trip time between the designer and developer, reducing product time-to-market. 

## QML

QML stands for Qt Meta-Object Language, AKA Qt Modelling Language, and it's a user interface markup language. 

The Qt QML module provides a framework for developing applications and libraries with the QML language. It defines and implements the language and engine infrastructure, and provides an API to enable application developers to extend the QML language with custom types and integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++. The Qt QML module provides both a QML API and a C++ API.

You'll want to work on your application logic using C++. It will in most cases result in better performance than implementing logic using JavaScript.

QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one another. It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to be easily reused and customized within a user interface. Using the Qt Quick module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user interfaces in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end C++ libraries.

With QML, UI components are declared with objects, object properties and property bindings, set to define the application behavior. It is possible to declare signals and signal/slot connections similarily to C++. Application behavior can be further scripted through JavaScript, which is a subset of the language. In addition, QML heavily uses Qt, which allows types and other Qt features to be accessible directly from QML applications. In fact, each JavaScript method in a QML type, also called as a component, is a public slot and can be connected to a signal. 

## .qml -files and QML syntax

// Pitäis mainita, että noi attribuutit on niitä QObject propertyjä ja että niitä voi määritellä myös dynaamisesti noissa QML-dokkareissa tai komponenteissa

QML is a multi-paradigm language that enables objects to be defined in terms of their attributes and how they relate and respond to changes in other objects. In contrast to purely imperative code, where changes in attributes and behavior are expressed through a series of statements that are processed step by step, QML's declarative syntax integrates attribute and behavioral changes directly into the definitions of individual objects. These attribute definitions can then include imperative code, in the case where complex custom application behavior is needed.

QML source code is generally loaded by the engine through QML (.qml) documents, which are standalone documents of QML code. These can be used to define QML object types that can then be reused throughout an application. A QML document, defining a new type, is also called a component,

Note that type names must begin with an uppercase letter in order to be declared as QML object types in a QML file.

### Imports

// While you could explain imports with a sentence + link, I think having it layed out like this has its benefits.

A QML document may have one or more imports at the top of the file. An import can be any one of:

* a versioned namespace into which types have been registered (e.g., by a plugin)
* a relative directory which contains type-definitions as QML documents
* a JavaScript file

JavaScript file imports must be qualified when imported, so that the properties and methods they provide can be accessed.  

The generic form of the various imports are as follows:

```qml
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor
import Namespace VersionMajor.VersionMinor as SingletonTypeIdentifier
import "directory"
import "file.js" as ScriptIdentifier
```

Examples:
```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.LocalStorage 2.0 as Database
import "../privateComponents"
import "somefile.js" as Script
```

### QML Object tree

Syntactically, a block of QML code defines a tree of QML objects to be created. Objects are defined using object declarations that describe the type of object to be created as well as the attributes that are to be given to the object. Any object declaration can define child objects through nested object declarations. In this way, any object declaration implicitly declares an object tree that may contain any number of child objects.

For example, the Rectangle object declaration below includes a Gradient object declaration, which in turn contains two GradientStop declarations:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    width: 100
    height: 100

    gradient: Gradient {
        GradientStop { position: 0.0; color: "yellow" }
        GradientStop { position: 1.0; color: "green" }
    }
}
```

Note, however, that this is a parent-child relationship in the context of the QML object tree, not in the context of the visual scene. The concept of a parent-child relationship in a visual scene is provided by the `Item` type from the QtQuick module, which is the base type for most QML types, as most QML objects are intended to be visually rendered. We we will discuss parent-child relationship in visual scene in the next chapter.

## Including QML in your projects

To include QML in your projects, you need to complete these three steps:  

1. To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    ```cpp
    #include <QtQml>
    ```

2. The QML types in Qt QML are available through the QtQML import. To use the types, add the following import statement to your .qml file:

    ```qml
    import QtQml 2.0
    ```

3. To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    ```qmake
    QT += qml
    ```

## Prototyping with Quick UI projects and qmlscene

To prototype user interfaces even more quickly, one can create a [Qt Quick UI](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/quick-projects.html) project. These projects do not contain any C++ code, resource `.qrc` or deployment code (`qmake` files). This way the potential designer can launch the application without compiling any code or developer can quickly share proof-of-concepts. For example in Qt Design Studio, it is possible to create Qt Quick UI projects only. The QML Scene can be executed also remotely in a mobile or embedded device and any change in UI editor will be reflected in the UI immediately. Qt Quick Designer does not have similar feature. 

One can also enable a keyboard shortcut for the prototyping application [`qmlscene`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-qmlscene.html), which renders any arbitary `.qml` files. `qmlscene` can be enabled in Qt Creator by going to `Options -> Environment -> Keyboard -> search for qmlscene -> assign shortcut`. When a `.qml` file is open in the Edit or Design mode, hit the shortcut to render the file.


## QML Object Attributes

// Mention C++ properties (Q_PROPERTY) vs dynamic QML property difference

// Move to chapter 3.09 - Components: Properties, Signals

Every QML object type has defined set of attributes. Each instance of an object type is created with the set of attributes that have been defined for that object type.

// Viittaus noihin property visibility-sääntöihin olis nyt tarpeen. Katsokaa alla. Lisäsin tuon according...

A property is an attribute of an object that can be assigned a static value or bound to a dynamic JavaScript expression or even a code block. A property's value can be read by other objects according to property visibility scope rules. Generally it can also be modified by another object, unless a particular QML type has explicitly disallowed this for a specific property.

// Tähän pitäis saada viimeistään viittaus QObject-propertyihin.

A custom or dynamic property of an object type may be defined in an object declaration in a QML document with the following syntax:

```qml
[default] property <propertyType> <propertyName>
```

In this way an object declaration may expose a particular value to outside objects or maintain some internal state more easily.

// Aliakset componenttilukuun, jos mahdollista

// BINDINGS!!!!! Vai onko ne seuraavassa osassa

### Property Aliases

Property aliases are properties which hold a reference to another property. Unlike an ordinary property definition, which allocates a new, unique storage space for the property, a property alias connects the newly declared property (called the aliasing property) as a direct reference to an existing property (the aliased property).

A property alias declaration looks like an ordinary property definition, except that it requires the alias keyword instead of a property type, and the right-hand-side of the property declaration must be a valid alias reference:

```qml
[default] property alias <name>: <alias reference>
```

Unlike an ordinary property, an alias has the following restrictions:

* It can only refer to an object, or the property of an object, that is within the scope of the type within which the alias is declared.
* It cannot contain arbitrary JavaScript expressions
* It cannot refer to objects declared outside of the scope of its type.
* The alias reference is not optional, unlike the optional default value for an ordinary property; the alias reference must be provided when the alias is first declared.
* It cannot refer to grouped properties; the following code will not work:

```qml
property alias color: rectangle.border.color

Rectangle {
    id: rectangle
}
```

However, aliases to value type properties do work:

```qml
property alias rectX: object.rectProperty.x

Item {
    id: object
    property rect rectProperty
}
```

We recommend you read through the [QML Object Attributes documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html) which goes into more detail than this chapter.
