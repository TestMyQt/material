Where can I find the course material?  

On this site we have included the course material and relevant exercises. We follow the format of course weeks, each week of the course revolving around a bigger topic. There are six course weeks in total These weekly topics include a number of subtopics and assignments attached to said subtopics.

We will include some relevant reference materials per week, this will mainly consist of links to Qt documentation and/or Wiki pages.

We recommend you to use the QMLBook as your course reference book, should you wish to use one. It contains relevant topics to this course and will provide with a second perspective to learning about getting the most out of developing with Qt. You can find the QMLBook here:

https://qmlbook.github.io/index.html

### Setting up the working environment

How do I set up my working environment?

_Here we want to include sufficient instructions for the student to effortlessly set up their working environment (Linux/Windows/Macintosh). This part of the documentation could possibly benefit from being tested on actual people once it's done._

**Qt Creator**

* https://download.qt.io/
* http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html

**Qt TMC plugin**

_Placeholder for download link to where the Qt TMC plugin is being distributed from._

* https://github.com/TestMyQt/Qt-CreatorTMC/wiki/User-guide:-Setting-up-your-workspace-and-getting-started

_The documentation above will need to be updated if/once the client side TMC plugin transitions from using `TMC-cli` to `autotest`._
