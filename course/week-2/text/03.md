## Course material content

To enable mouse interaction with elements, `MouseArea` can be used. It's an invisible rectangular item that can capture mouse events and can be nested into an element like so:

Rectangle {
         width: 100; height: 100
         color: "green"
     
         MouseArea {
             anchors.fill: parent
             onClicked: parent.color = 'red'
         }
     }

Now the logic of mouse handling is contained within the `MouseArea` item. This distinction is an important aspect of Qt Quick UIs, as this separates the input handling from visual presentations. This enables the visual items to be what ever the size they may be, but the input is only accepted within constraints defined in the input elements.

### Generic mouse events using the left mouse button

By default `MouseArea` reacts to the left mouse button and signals `onClicked`. To set `MouseArea` react to other types of buttons, set the `acceptedButtons` property with desired [`Qt::MouseButton`](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#MouseButton-enum) flag. Multiple flags can be combined with the `|` (or) operator. To access the currently pressed buttons, the `&` (and) operator can be used with the property `pressedButtons`.

In addition to the convenient `onClicked` handler, there are other handlers such as `onPressed`, `onWheel` or `onPositionChanged` that make it possible to handle more specific mouse events.

When emitted, many `MouseArea` signals pass in a `mouse` parameter that contains information about the mouse event, such as the position, button type and any key modifiers.

In this example we enable the left and right button of the mouse, and change the `Rectangle` color accordingly:

     Rectangle {
         width: 100; height: 100
         color: "green"
     
         MouseArea {
             anchors.fill: parent
             acceptedButtons: Qt.LeftButton | Qt.RightButton
             onClicked: if (mouse.button == Qt.RightButton)
                            parent.color = 'blue';
                        else
                            parent.color = 'red';
         }
     }


### Visualizing the mouse hover

By default, `MouseArea` has handled mouse events when it has been clicked or buttons are held down, but it can also handle events when the mouse is currently hovering inside the area.

To enable hover event handling, the property `hoverEnabled` must be set to `true`. This affects the handlers `onEntered`, `onExited` and `onPositionChanged`. Handlers `onEntered` and `onExited` are signaled when the mouse enters or exits the area, and can be used to highlight or activate items. The `onPositionChanged` handler is signaled whenever the mouse moves inside the area. 

This example demonstrates text following the cursor whenever the mouse enters the `MouseArea`:

     Text {
         id: cursorText
         text: "hover"
     }
     
     MouseArea {
         anchors.fill: parent
         hoverEnabled: true
         onPositionChanged: {
             cursorText.x = mouse.x
             cursorText.y = mouse.y
         } 
     }

### Dragging items

In some UIs, it is beneficial to make some elements draggable, like volume sliders or images. `MouseArea` contains property `drag` that makes this possible.

`drag` itself has properties that are used to specify how the dragging is done.

1. `drag.target` specifies the id of the item to drag.
2. `drag.active` specifies if the target item is currently being dragged.
3. `drag.axis` specifies whether dragging can be done horizontally (`Drag.XAxis`), vertically (`Drag.YAxis`), or both (`Drag.XAndYAxis`)
4. `drag.minimum` and `drag.maximum`: how far the target can be dragged along the specified axes.
