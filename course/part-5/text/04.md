# 5.04 - C++ Models in QML

We've talked about making your own models to present data in QML few times now, and in the last chapter we saw basic example of `QStandardItemModel`. Often it's needed to implement your own model from the start for performance and functionality reasons. `QAbstactItemModel` class provides the abstract interface for item model classes, and it can be subclassed to create your own models. `QAbstractListModel` and `QAbstractTableModel` inherit `QAbstractItemModel` and can be subclassed instead when making list or table models. In this chapter we'll be taking a closer look at `QAbstractTableModel`.

## QAbstractTableModel

When making your own table model by subclassing `QAbstractTableModel`, you must at the very least implement functions `rowCount()`, `columnCount()`, and `data()`.

To make our model available in QML we also need to reimplement `roleNames` (like in the `QStandardItemModel` example in the last chapter).

Editable models need to also implement `setData()` and `flags()`.

Models that provide interfaces to resizable data structures can provide implementations for inserting and removing rows and columns as well, but if you do so it's important to remember to call appropriate functions so that all connected views are aware of any changes:

* `beginInsertRows()` / `beginInsertColumns()` must be called before inserting new rows and/or columns into the data structure, and `endInsertRows()` / `endInsertColumns()` immediately afterwards.
* `removeRows()`/ `removeColumns()` must be called before removing rows and/or columns from the data structure, and `endRemoveRows()` / `endRemoveColumsn()` immediately afterwards.

### Example

// There's something to be said about presenting an example that's an editable table with inserting of rows/columns, but after trying it I feel it's too long of an example to be read in material. As such, I'm thinking that those could just come in the exercise (this would also make it so you can't just edit the example for the exercise).

In the header we define `Car` as the item we're storing in the table. Enums for roles are done in the same manner as we did in `QStandardItemModel`. When subclassing `QAbstractTableModel` we need to implement, at minimum, `rowCount()`, `columnCount()`, `data()`, and `roleNames()`:

```cpp
// customtablemodel.h
#include <QAbstractTableModel>

struct Car
{
    QString manufacturer;
    QString model;
    qint16 year;
};
typedef QVector<Car> CarContainer;

class CustomTableModel : public QAbstractTableModel
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    enum CarRoles {
        ManufacturerRole = Qt::UserRole + 1,
        ModelRole,
        YearRole
    };

    explicit CustomTableModel(QObject *parent = nullptr);

protected:
    int rowCount(const QModelIndex &parent) const Q_DECL_OVERRIDE;
    int columnCount(const QModelIndex &parent) const Q_DECL_OVERRIDE;
    QVariant data(const QModelIndex &index, int role) const Q_DECL_OVERRIDE;
    QHash<int, QByteArray> roleNames() const Q_DECL_OVERRIDE;

private:
    CarContainer m_container;
};
```

The code in .cpp file is fairly self-explanatory. We're adding data in the constructor just for the example:

```cpp
// customtablemodel.cpp
#include "customtablemodel.h"

CustomTableModel::CustomTableModel(QObject *parent) :
    QAbstractTableModel(parent)
{
    m_container = {
        Car{"Mercedes", "E200D", 2014},
        Car{"Toyota", "Corolla", 1998},
        Car{"Audi", "A6", 2006},
        Car{"Tesla", "Model 3", 2018},
        Car{"Ford", "Fiesta", 2000},
        Car{"Dodge", "Charger", 1968},
    };
}

int CustomTableModel::rowCount(const QModelIndex &parent) const
{
    Q_UNUSED(parent)
    return m_container.count();
}

int CustomTableModel::columnCount(const QModelIndex &parent) const
{
    Q_UNUSED(parent)
    return 3;
}

QVariant CustomTableModel::data(const QModelIndex &index, int role) const
{
    switch(role)
    {
    case ManufacturerRole:
        return m_container[index.row()].manufacturer;
    case ModelRole:
        return m_container[index.row()].model;
    case YearRole:
        return m_container[index.row()].year;
    }
    return QVariant();
}

QHash<int, QByteArray> CustomTableModel::roleNames() const
{
    QHash<int, QByteArray> roles;
    roles[ManufacturerRole] = "manufacturer";
    roles[ModelRole] = "model";
    roles[YearRole] = "year";
    return roles;
}
```

Then we register it like before (Note that in this example the only data is from the constuctor, as we didn't implement functionality to add data from QML.):

```cpp
// main.cpp
qmlRegisterType<CustomTableModel>("org.mooc.customtable", 1, 0, "CustomTableModel");
```

On the QML side we are using the new `TableView` item that was introduced in Qt 5.12, so remember to import `QtQuick 2.12` (Note: Don't confuse it with the deprecated Quick Controls 1 TabelView).

The data from our model is available by the role names we defined in `roleNames()` function.

// **Note: I couldn't find a single example that actually had more than a single display role, so I've no idea if the if-elseif-else construct is correct to use here. It's just what I managed to get to work**

```qml
// main.qml
import QtQuick 2.12
import QtQuick.Window 2.12
import org.mooc.customtable 1.0

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: qsTr("CustomTableModel")

    TableView {
        anchors.fill: parent
        columnSpacing: 0
        rowSpacing: 1
        clip: true

        model: CustomTableModel {}

        delegate: Rectangle {
            implicitWidth: 60
            implicitHeight: 40
            color: {
                if (row % 2 == 0)
                    "lightblue";
                else
                    "white";
            }
            Text {
                anchors.centerIn: parent
                text: {
                    if (column == 0)
                        manufacturer;
                    else if (column == 1)
                        model;
                    else
                        year;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

![TableView]({{ "/assets/images/part-5/tableview.png" | absolute_url }})

```
