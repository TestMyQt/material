# 5.03 - Adding New QML Types

So far we've discussed how to expose an object instance to the QML context. Sometimes we want to register the class itself to be used in QML. The registration allows the class to be used as a data type from QML. Additionally registration can provide other features, such as allowing a class to be used as an instantiable QML object type from QML, or enabling a singleton instance fo the class to be imported and used from QML.

Usually we register classes that derive from `QObject` that use the macro `Q_OBJECT`, but it is also possible to register a "lighter" version of `QObject`, declared with a `Q_GADGET` macro instead. In these lighter classes we have access to properties, enums, and invokable methods, but not to the signals and slots system. But more on that a little bit later.

## Registration

### Instantiable Types

To register a `QObject`-derived class as an instantiable QML object type, call `qmlRegisterType()` to register the class as QML type into a particular type namespace. Clients can then import that namespace in order to use that type.

For example, suppose there is a `Message` class with `author` and `creationDate` properties:

```cpp
class Message : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(QString author READ author WRITE setAuthor NOTIFY authorChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(QDateTime creationDate READ creationDate WRITE setCreationDate NOTIFY creationDateChanged)
public:
    // ...
};
```

This type can be registered by calling `qmlRegisterType()` with an appropriate type namespace and version number. For example, to make the type available in the `com.mycompany.messaging` namespace with version 1.0:

```cpp
qmlRegisterType<Message>("com.mycompany.messaging", 1, 0, "Message");
```

The type can be used in an object declaration from QML, and its properties can be read and written to, as per the example below:

```qml
import com.mycompany.messaging 1.0

Message {
    author: "Amelie"
    creationDate: new Date()
}
```

### Non-instantiable Types

Sometimes a `QObject`-derived class may need to be registered with the QML type system but not as an instantiable type. For example, this is the case if a C++ class:

* is an interface type that should not be instantiable
* is a base class type that does not need to be exposed to QML
* declares some enum that should be accessible from QML, but otherwise should not be instantiable
* is a type that should be provided to QML through a singleton instance, and should not be instantiable from QML

The Qt QML module provides several methods for registering non-instantiable types:

* `qmlRegisterType()` (with no parameters) registers a C++ type that is not instantiable and cannot be referred to from QML. This enables the engine to coerce any inherited types that are instantiable from QML.
* `qmlRegisterInterface()` registers a Qt interface type with a specific QML type name. The type is not instantiable from QML but can be referred to by its type name.
* `qmlRegisterUncreatableType()` registers a named C++ type that is not instantiable but should be identifiable as a type to the QML type system. This is useful if a type's enums or attached properties should be accessible from QML but the type itself should not be instantiable.
* `qmlRegisterSingletonType()` registers a singleton type that can be imported from QML.

For example, let's talk about a Singleton type.

A `QObject` singleton type can be interacted with in a manner similar to any other `QObject` or instantiated type, except that only one (engine constructed and owned) instance will exist, and it must be referenced by type name rather than id. `Q_PROPERTY`s of `QObject` singleton types may be bound to, and `Q_INVOKABLE` functions of `QObject` module APIs may be used in signal handler expressions. This makes singleton types an ideal way to implement styling or theming.

Say we have a singleton type for theming registered into `MyThemeModule` namespace with version 1.0, where that `QObject` has a `QColor color` property. We can then use it simply with:

```qml
import MyThemeModule 1.0 as Theme

Rectangle {
    color: Theme.color // binding.
}
```

Another example would be a case where we have a class just for enumerations. As a side note, in this case we can use the lighter `Q_GADGET` macro mentioned before (as we won't be needing signals and slots):

```cpp
// modeclass.h
#include <QObject>

class ModeClass
{
    Q_GADGET
public:
    explicit ModeClass();
    enum Mode { Slow, Normal, Fast, UsainBolt };
    Q_ENUM(Mode)
};
```

and register it with:

```cpp
qmlRegisterUncreatableType<ModeClass>("com.mycompany.modes", 1, 0, "ModeClass", "Message");
```

## Creating Custom QObjects

Let's look at how to create a custom `QObject`-derived class for use in QML by starting with an example:

```cpp
// cppperson.h
class CppPerson : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(QString name READ name WRITE setName NOTIFY nameChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(int shoeSize READ shoeSize WRITE setShoeSize NOTIFY shoeSizeChanged)
public:
    CppPerson(QObject *parent = nullptr);

    QString name() const;
    void setName(const QString &name);

    int shoeSize() const;
    void setShoeSize(int size);

signals:
    void nameChanged();
    void shoeSizeChanged();

private:
    QString m_name;
    int m_shoeSize;
};
```

```cpp
// cppperson.cpp
#include "cppperson.h"

CppPerson::CppPerson(QObject *parent) :
    QObject(parent), m_shoeSize(0)
{
}

QString CppPerson::name() const
{
    return m_name;
}

void CppPerson::setName(const QString &name)
{
    if (m_name != name) {
        m_name = name;
        emit nameChanged();
    }
}

int CppPerson::shoeSize() const
{
    return m_shoeSize;
}

void CppPerson::setShoeSize(int size)
{
    if (m_shoeSize != size) {
        m_shoeSize = size;
        emit shoeSizeChanged();
    }
}
```

```cpp
// main.cpp
...
qmlRegisterType<CppPerson>("People", 1,0, "Person");
...
```

```qml
// main.qml
import QtQuick 2.9
import QtQuick.Window 2.3
import People 1.0

Window {
    width: 640; height: 480
    visible: true

    Rectangle {
        anchors.fill: parent

        // Person is implemented in C++
        Person {
            id: person
            name: "Bob Jones"
            shoeSize: 12
            onNameChanged: {
                console.log("New name: " + name)
            }
            onShoeSizeChanged: {
                console.log("New shoe size: " + shoeSize)
            }
        }

        Column {
            anchors.fill:  parent
            spacing: 20
            Text {
                font.bold: true
                font.pixelSize: 26
                text: "Person name: " + person.name
            }
            Text {
                font.bold: true
                font.pixelSize: 26
                text: "Person shoe size: " + person.shoeSize
            }
        }

        MouseArea {
            anchors.fill: parent
            onClicked: {
                person.name = "John Doe"
                person.shoeSize = 9
            }
        }
    }
}

```

The C++ side should be starting to look familiar by now, we declare the properties and their accessors and signals with `Q_PROPERTY` in the header file, and implement the getters and setters in `cppperson.cpp` (and not forgetting to emit those `xxxChanged` signals in the setters!).

On QML we import the now-registered type, and then use it like we would any other QML type. Property bindings are done by name like usual, and slots for the signal automatically exists following the naming convention `onXxxChanged`.

## QStandardItemModel

A common need is to implement a model in C++ to store data, which is then displayed in QML. More specialized usecases often require us to write our own model, for example in the next chapter we'll be implementing our own Table model by subclassing `QAbstractTableModel` (which itself inherits `QAbstractItemModel`). Qt also provides a simple general-purpose model for storing custom data, called `QStandardItemModel`.

```cpp
// mymodel.h
#include <QStandardItemModel>

class MyModel : public QStandardItemModel
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    enum Roles {
        BrandRole = Qt::UserRole + 1,
        ModelRole
    };

    explicit MyModel(QObject *parent = nullptr);

    QHash<int, QByteArray> roleNames() const Q_DECL_OVERRIDE;

    Q_INVOKABLE void addCar(const QString &brand, const QString &model);
};
```

```cpp
// mymodel.cpp
#include "mymodel.h"

MyModel::MyModel(QObject *parent) : QStandardItemModel(parent)
{
}

QHash<int, QByteArray> MyModel::roleNames() const
{
    QHash<int, QByteArray> mapping = QStandardItemModel::roleNames();
    mapping[BrandRole] = "brand";
    mapping[ModelRole] = "model";
    return mapping;
}

void MyModel::addCar(const QString &brand, const QString &model)
{
    QStandardItem *item = new QStandardItem;
    item->setData(brand, BrandRole);
    item->setData(model, ModelRole);
    appendRow(item);
}
```

The most imporant part to note here is overriding of the `roleNames()` function, where the named roles are mapped to numbers (enums). This allows us to refer to the data in QML with the names "brand" and "model".

Also, don't forget to declare `addCar` with `Q_INVOKABLE` to allow it's usage in QML.

```cpp
// main.cpp
qmlRegisterType<MyModel>("org.mooc.cars", 1, 0, "MyModel");
```

```qml
// main.qml
import QtQuick 2.9
import QtQuick.Window 2.2
import org.mooc.cars 1.0

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: qsTr("Cars")

    MyModel {
        id: cars
    }

    ListView {
        model: cars
        anchors.fill: parent
        delegate: Text {
            text: "The brand is " + brand + " and the model is " + model
        }
    }

    // Some way to populate the model, cars.addCar("brand", "model")
    ...
}

```

## QML Plugins

When a custom QML component is imported it's loaded into memory at the start. To shorten start times you can make the component a plugin instead, in which case it's dynamically loaded once you create an object.

To write a QML extension plugin we:
* Subclass `QQmlExtensionPlugin`
* Write a project file for the plugin
* Create a `qmldir` file to describe the plugin

Suppose we have a `TimeModel` C++ class that should be made available as a new QML type. It provides the current time through `hour` and `minute` properties.

```cpp
class TimeModel : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(int hour READ hour NOTIFY timeChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(int minute READ minute NOTIFY timeChanged)
    ...
```

Now we create a class called `QExampleQmlPlugin` which inherits `QmlExtensionPlugin`:

```cpp
class QExampleQmlPlugin : public QQmlExtensionPlugin
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID QQmlExtensionInterface_iid)

public:
    void registerTypes(const char *uri) override
    {
        Q_ASSERT(uri == QLatin1String("TimeExample"));
        qmlRegisterType<TimeModel>(uri, 1, 0, "Time");
    }
};
```

* We use the `Q_PLUGIN_METADATA()` macro to register the plugin with the meta object system with a unique identifier.
* We override the `registerTypes()` method to register the `TimeModel` type with `qmlRegisterType`.
* `Q_ASSERT` isn't mandatory here, but we can use it to ensure the type namespace is imported correctly by any QML components that use this plugin.

Next, we need a `.pro` project file:

```
TEMPLATE = lib
CONFIG += qt plugin
QT += qml

DESTDIR = imports/TimeExample
TARGET = qmlqtimeexampleplugin
SOURCES += qexampleqmlplugin.cpp
```

It defines the project as a plugin library, specifies the built directory, and register the plugin target name.

Lastly, we need a `qmldir` file to describe the plugin:

```
module TimeExample
plugin qmlqtimeexampleplugin
```
