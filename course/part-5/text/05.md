# 5.05 - Scene Graph Item

Qt Quick 2 makes use of dedicated scene graph for its rendering. Using a scene graph for graphics rather than the traditional imperative painting systems (`QPainter` or similar), means the scene to be rendered can be retained between frames and the complete set of primitives to render is known before rendering starts. This means there is room for a number of optimizations, such as batch rendering to minimize state changes and discarding obscured primitives.

For example, say a user-interface contains a list of ten items where each item has a background color, an icon and a text. Using the traditional drawing techniques, this would result in 30 draw calls and a similar amount of state changes. A scene graph, on the other hand, could reorganize the primitives to render such that all backgrounds are drawn in one call, then all icons, then all the text, reducing the total amount of draw calls to only 3. Batching and state change reduction like this can greatly improve performance on some hardware.

The scene graph is closely tied to Qt Quick 2.0 and can not be used stand-alone. The scene graph is managed and rendered by the `QQuickWindow` class and custom `Item` types can add their graphical primitives into the scene graph through a call to `QQuickItem::updatePaintNode()`.

## Scene Graph Structure

The scene graph is composed of a number of predefined node types, each serving a dedicated purpose. Although we refer to it as a scene graph, a more precise definition is node tree. The tree is built from `QQuickItem` types in the QML scene and internally the scene is then processed by a renderer which draws the scene. The nodes themselves do not contain any active drawing code nor virtual `paint()` function.

### Nodes

The most important node for users is the `QSGGeometryNode`. It is used to define custom graphics by defining its geometry and material. The geometry is defined using `QSGGeometry` and describes the shape or mesh of the graphical primitive. It can be a line, a rectangle, a polygon, many disconnected rectangles, or complex 3D mesh. The material defines how the pixels in this shape are filled.

A node can have any number of children and geometry nodes will be rendered so they appear in child-order with parents behind their children.

### Materials

The material describes how the interior of a geometry in a `QSGGeometryNode` is filled. It encapsulates an OpenGL shader program and provides ample flexibility in what can be achieved, though most of the Qt Quick items themselves only use very basic materials, such as solid color and texture fills.

Available material classes are:

* `QSGFlatColorMaterial` - Convenient way of rendering solid colored geometry in the scene graph
* `QSGMaterial` - Encapsulates rendering state for a shader program
* `QSGMaterialShader` - Represents an OpenGL shader program in the renderer
* `QSGMaterialType` - Used as a unique type token in combination with `QSGMaterial`
* `QSGOpaqueTextureMaterial` - Convenient way of rendering textured geometry in the scene graph
* `QSGSimpleMaterial` - Template generated class used to store the state used with a `QSGSimpleMateralShader`
* `QSGSimpleMaterialShader` - Convenient way of building custom OpenGL-based materials for the scene graph
* `QSGTextureMaterial` - Convenient way of rendering textured geometry in the scene graph
* `QSGVertexColorMaterial` - Convenient way of rendering per-vertex colored geometry in the scene graph

## Example

Now, let's look at a simple example where we use Scene Graph Item to draw a triangle.

```cpp
// triangleitem.h
class TriangleItem : public QQuickItem
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    TriangleItem(QQuickItem *parent = nullptr);

protected:
    QSGNode *updatePaintNode(QSGNode *node, UpdatePaintNodeData *data);

private:
    QSGGeometry m_geometry;
    QSGFlatColorMaterial m_material;
};
```

```cpp
// triangleitem.cpp
#include "triangleitem.h"
#include <QSGGeometryNode>

TriangleItem::TriangleItem(QQuickItem *parent)
    : QQuickItem(parent),
      m_geometry(QSGGeometry::defaultAttributes_Point2D(), 3)
{
    setFlag(ItemHasContents);
    m_material.setColor(Qt::red);
}

QSGNode *TriangleItem::updatePaintNode(QSGNode *n, UpdatePaintNodeData *)
{
    QSGGeometryNode *node = dynamic_cast<QSGGeometryNode *>(n);
    if (!node) {
        node = new QSGGeometryNode();
    }

    QSGGeometry::Point2D *v = m_geometry.vertexDataAsPoint2D();
    const QRectF rect = boundingRect();
    v[0].x = rect.left();
    v[0].y = rect.bottom();

    v[1].x = rect.left() + rect.width()/2;
    v[1].y = rect.top();

    v[2].x = rect.right();
    v[2].y = rect.bottom();

    node->setGeometry(&m_geometry);
    node->setMaterial(&m_material);

    return node;
}
```

```cpp
// main.cpp
...
qmlRegisterType<TriangleItem>("ShapeObjects", 1, 0, "Triangle");
...
```

```qml
import QtQuick 2.9
import QtQuick.Window 2.3
import ShapeObjects 1.0

Window {
    width: 640; height: 480
    visible: true

    Item {
        width: 300; height: 200

        Triangle {
            x: 50; y: 50
            width: 200; height: 100
        }
    }
}

```

Few important points to notice in the example:
* We are subclassing `QQuickItem` which is the base class for all visual items in Qt Quick.
* We are using `QSGGeometryNode` as the node and `QSGFlatColorMaterial` as the material.
* We are setting the flag `setFlag(ItemHasContents)` in the constructor to indicate that the item should be rendered by the scene graph.
* We implement the `updatePaintNode` function to do the actual painting (Note: It is crucial that OpenGL operations and interaction with the scene graph happens exclusively on the render thread, primarily during the `updatePaintNode()` call. The rule of thumb is to only sue classes with teh `QSG`prefix inside the `QQuickItem::updatePaintNode()` function)
