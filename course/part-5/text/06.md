# 5.06 - QML Profiler

Now that the course is drawing to a close, let's talk about something little different. QML Profiler is a tool to find typical performance problems in your applications, such as slowness and unresponsive, stuttering user interfaces. Typical causes include executing too much JavaScript in too few frames. All JavaScript must return before the GUI thread can proceed, and frames are delayed or dropped if the GUI thread is not ready.

Another typical cause for similar performance problems is creating, painting, or updating invisible items, which takes time in the GUI thread.

Triggering long-running C++ functions, such as paint methods and signal handlers, also takes time in the GUI thread, but is more difficult to see in the QML Profiler, because it does not profile C++ code.

To find excessive use of JavaScript, check the frame rate in animations and Scene Graph events, look for gaps, and check whether the application behaves as expected. The JavaScript category displays the run time of functions, which you should try to keep below 16 ms per frame.

To find problems caused by handling invisible items, look for dropped frames and check that you are not using too many short bindings or signal handlers that are updated per frame. You can also [visualize Scene Graph overdraw](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#visualizing-overdraw) to check scene layout and find items that are never visible to the users, because they are located outside the screen or hidden beneath other, visible elements.

If frames get dropped even though JavaScript is not being run, and there are large, unexplained gaps in the timeline, check your custom `QQuickItem` implementations. You can use Valgrind or other general purpose profilers to analyze C++ code.

## Using QML Profiler

To use QML profiler you need to set up QML debugging for the project if you haven't already (see [Setting up QML debugging](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-debugging-qml.html#setting-up-qml-debugging) for more information) and use a kit with Qt  version 4.7.4 or later (you should be using Qt 5 for this course anyway, so this shouldn't be an issue).

Select **Analyze > QML Profiler** in the top menubar of Qt Creator. Start you application and start the data collection with the Start button, and click on Enable Profiling when you're done (do this before you exit the application).

## Analyzing Collected Data

### Timeline

The Timeline view displays graphical representations of QML and JavaScript execution and a condensed view of all recorded events.

![Timeline]({{ "/assets/images/part-5/profiler-timeline.png" | absolute_url }})

Each row in the timeline (6) describes a type of QML events that were recorded. Move the cursor on an event on a row to see how long it takes and where in the source it is being called. To display the information only when an event is selected, disable the View Event Information on Mouseover button (4).

The outline (10) summarizes the period for which data was collected. Drag the zoom range (8) or click the outline to move on the outline. You can also move between events by selecting the Jump to Previous Event and Jump to Next Event buttons (1).

Select the Show Zoom Slider button (2) to open a slider that you can use to set the zoom level. You can also drag the zoom handles (9). To reset the default zoom level, right-click the timeline to open the context menu, and select Reset Zoom.

Click the time ruler to add vertical orientation lines (5) to the timeline.

### Statistics

The Statistics view displays the number of times each binding, create, compile, JavaScript, or signal event is triggered and the average time it takes. This allows you to examine which events you need to optimize. A high number of occurrences might indicate that an event is triggered unnecessarily. To view the median, longest, and shortest time for the occurrences, select Extended Event Statistics in the context menu.

Click on an event to move to it in the source code in the code editor.

### Flame Graphs

The Flame Graph view shows a more concise statistical overview of QML and JavaScript execution. In the Visualize Total Time view, the horizontal bars show the amount of time all invocations of a certain function took together, relative to the total runtime of all JavaScript and QML events. The nesting shows which functions were called by which other ones.

![Flamegraph]({{ "/assets/images/part-5/profiler-flamegraph.png" | absolute_url }})

To view the total amount of memory allocated by the functions in the Visualize Memory view, select Memory in the drop-down menu (1).

To view the the number of memory allocations performed by the functions in the Visualize Allocations view, select Allocations in the drop-down menu.

Double-click an item in a view to zoom into it. Double-click an empty area in the view to zoom out again.

Unlike the Timeline view, the Flame Graph view does not show the time spans when no QML or JavaScript is running at all. Thus, it is not suitable for analyzing per frame execution times. However, it is very easy to see the total impact of the various QML and JavaScript events there.
